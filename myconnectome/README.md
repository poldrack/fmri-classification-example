# fmri-classification-example
An example of classification using n-back task data from myconnectome.  The images are included in the repository.

To run this example, you need to do the following (this works on Mac or Linux - Windows users are on their own):

1. Install the scientific python stack - I would recommend using the [Anaconda python distribution] (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
2. Install nibabel and nilearn: <pre><code>pip install nibabel nilearn</pre></code>
3. Clone this repository: <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/poldrack/fmri-classification-example.git</pre></code>
4. Go into the fmri-classification-example directory, and run the ipython notebook using: <pre><code>ipython notebook Mind-reading-using-fmri.ipynb</pre></code>
